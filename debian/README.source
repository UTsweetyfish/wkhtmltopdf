wkhtmltopdf for Debian
----------------------

This package uses quilt to manage all modifications to the upstream
source. Changes are stored in the source package as diffs in
debian/patches and applied during the build. Please see:

    /usr/share/doc/quilt/README.source

for more information on how to apply the patches, modify patches, or
remove a patch.
